# Hermes ‚Äî Trading Companion (developer notes)

This README contains concise local developer instructions for running the backend and the full stack during development.

## Quick local backend (venv)

1. Create a virtualenv and activate it:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install minimal dependencies (development):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Note: Some packages (pydantic-core, LightGBM) can require platform toolchains (Rust, libomp).
- Recommendation: Use Python 3.11 for best compatibility with SQLAlchemy/Alembic and many binary wheels used by the project. If you hit build errors, either:
- - Use Python 3.11 (prebuilt wheels are more common), or
- Use the Docker instructions below to run inside containers where build-time issues are avoided.

3. Run the backend in development mode:

```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn backend.simple_main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

4. ML model fallback: a small sklearn model has been saved to `backend/ml/artifacts/lightgbm_model.pkl` so `/predict` will work even if native LightGBM isn't available.

## Full stack (Docker compose)

This repo includes a `docker-compose.yml` that defines `backend`, `db` (Postgres), and `redis` services. Docker is recommended for full integration testing.

```bash
# from project root
docker compose up -d --build

# View backend logs
docker compose logs -f backend
```

Notes:
- The `backend` service reads `REDIS_URL` and `DATABASE_URL` from the environment. See `.env.example` for suggestions.
- If Docker isn't available on your machine, follow the venv instructions above instead.

## Optional: FinBERT sentiment

FinBERT support is optional. To enable:

1. Install transformers (and optionally sentencepiece):

```bash
pip install "transformers[sentencepiece]"
```

2. Set `FINBERT_MODEL` or `FINBERT_PATH` to a huggingface model id or local path:

```bash
export FINBERT_MODEL=ProsusAI/finbert
```

The sentiment endpoint will use FinBERT when configured; otherwise it uses a heuristic.

## Notes & Troubleshooting
- If `pip install -r requirements.txt` fails while building wheels (pydantic-core, LightGBM), use Docker or switch to Python 3.11/3.12.
- The project supports a Redis-backed distributed rate limiter. Ensure `REDIS_URL` points to a reachable Redis instance when running multiple backend workers.

## Next developer tasks
- Add Redis health-check during backend startup (pending)
- Improve training pipeline with real historical OHLCV data and retrain LightGBM/GRU models
- Wire Flutter frontend to backend endpoints and test end-to-end
